@par Example Description

This example shows how to use IWDG module functions.
That action includes the following steps:
    - IWDG module initialization;
    - Reload IWDG counter.

LED1 is used to indicate when counnter value updated.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c         Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VE91 eval board with MDR1986VE91 microcontroller.
    - VD7 (LED1) are connected to PD.10 pin.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_config.h
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
        MDR32F9Qx_iwdg.c
    - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
